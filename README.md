# Study Jesus Daily (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a ready-to-deploy React app for GitHub Pages. It builds with Vite and Tailwind.
No terminal needed locally — just upload to GitHub and let Actions build & deploy.

## Quick Start (no terminal)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub called anything you want.
2. Upload these files (drag-and-drop or "Add file" > "Upload files").
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:
   - **Source**: "GitHub Actions".
4. Push to `main` (e.g., by uploading). The workflow will build and deploy automatically.
5. Your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Notes
- The build sets the correct `base` path automatically from the repo name.
- If you change the repo name later, just push again and it will redeploy.
